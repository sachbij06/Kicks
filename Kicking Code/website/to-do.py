#to-do


# 1. Adjust math inside the session.py charting handler (coordinates are a little off with college posts)
# 2. Create a better UI for the homepage
# 3. Sort through stats in _math.py and clean up the handling
# 4. Setup the visual that you wrote down on the piece of paper inside the stats.html file
# 5. Create KO charting capability in session.html/session.py
# 6. Think about how to enhance Visualization page (do we even need it if we have the statistics page?)
